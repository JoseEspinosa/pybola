## Pergola

The advent of new technologies in the field of behavioral neuroscience allows for 
the collection of big chunks of longitudinal data. Dealing with such a huge amount
of data sometimes is difficult and it is very important to have good visualization
tools so that we let data  “speak”.  However, this problem is not new in biology 
and other disciplines, such as genomics, have long dealt with it.  So why not take
advantage of it? pergola aims is to be  a simple tool for behavioral data 
manipulation in order to visualize data in popular genome browsers.
